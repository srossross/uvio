Welcome to uvio!
================================

This module provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources, running network clients and servers, named pipes, threadding, subprocesses and more.

This is a complete replacement for python's `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html>`_ module.
